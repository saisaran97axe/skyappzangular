              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>➤ Mostly yes. Although we prefer to work with our own designs as that helps us to deliver maximum value. Nevertheless, we are flexible and adaptive to your requirements.</p>
              <p>➤ We will screen your designs to check their effectiveness. If they are strong, we will be more than happy to take on from there.</p>
              <p>➤ However, if the designs do not meet our basic standards, we will be honest and recommend you to reconsider.</p>

                How long will it take to build and launch my app ?
            </mat-panel-title>
            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Developing and launching a mobile app is a multi-faceted process. After the development is complete, the app is rigorously tested for software bugs and usability issues before launching it on the respective app store.</p>
            <p>On average, it may take anywhere between three and nine months to build and launch your app. The time taken precisely depends on factors like app complexity, project structure, number of features incorporated, location of the app development company, etc. Here is a quick breakup of the most time-consuming stages of the development process:</p>
            <p>➤ Project brief and researching: 2-6 weeks</p>
            <p>➤ Design sprints: 4-8 weeks</p>
            <p>➤ Development: 6-12 weeks</p>
            <p>➤ Deploying the app to the app stores: 1-2 weeks</p>
            <p>➤ Post-launch support: Ongoing</p>

<p>➤ Encrypt all data and store it in the local memory.</p>
<p>➤ Implement proper logging procedures.</p>
<p>➤ Use real-time security monitoring and protection.</p>
